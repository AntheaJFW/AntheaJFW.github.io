The Hackathon
---
First time at a Hackathon, I wasn't sure what to expect. I signed up two weeks before the event, with the thought that hackathons are reserved only for data scientists by profession. However, that turns out not to be true! Many of the teams comprised of people who come from different backgrounds who wish to learn data science, whether it is to get ideas on how one can leverage data to manage their own business, or get ideas on the types of things in which data scientists look out for in a presentation.

Our team alone comes from different backgrounds such as business development or logistics. This alone highlights how data analytics is becoming increasingly important as the need for analytics spreads across industries.

Check out our presentation below!:
